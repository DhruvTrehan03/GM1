Different Location:
	- Where can we take SpO2 readings from
		- Ear lobes/ Other peripherals (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016573/#:~:text=Ear%20probes%20consistently%20showed%20the,sensor%20sites%20in%2045%20patients.)
		- Patches (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6226280/)
		-  Blood Pressure Measuring (partial pressures)
		- Across the chest
		- Glasses / Ear loop (In canal?)
		- Ring (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8440715)
		- Sock - elastic band across ankle could proved tight fit ![[Pasted image 20240214155909.png]]
	- Levels of accuracy
	- Required level of accuracy
Different Variables: 
	- Which variables effect it
	- Which sensors would we need to get reliable readings
		- Movement - Accelerometer - can be used for safety readings too
		- Body Position of Person
		- Wireless communication
		- 
Parallel Fields
	- Blood Glucose Monitors
		- Microneedles
Cleaning and Hygiene may need to be explored
