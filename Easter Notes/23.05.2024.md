## Poster Feedback:

- Avoid pitfalls of other people to make something better than them
- Decide target audience 
- Formatting (smaller side margins, larger top and bottom margins)
- Navigable (easy to follow the flow of the poster)
- Don't overdo technical detail (need an external opinion)
- Story-tell
- Motivation
- Be clear what the problem is and state it (we are unable to, existing technology fails to do this.. negative words)
- Include negativity
- Rule of thumb (headings readable from 8 feet, text from 5 feet )
- Non-Designer's Design Book
- Vis-check (check for visual impairment problems)
- Clear, labelled graphs, break down information


- Practise how you present, choreograph
- Don't look back at slides

#### Feedback:
- Space out text better
- better alignement
